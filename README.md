## Simple Mandlebrot Set Generator

This is (slightly convoluted) mandlebrot set generator. The algrithm is implemented iteratively. At the top of the source file, you can find the parameters used to defined the plot bounds, maximum iterations, etc...

# To compile
`gcc mandlebrot.c -o mandlebrot -lm`

# To run
`./mandlebrot`

The default resolution is `24 x 80`, but you can change this as you see fit.
